Hello! My name is Dun Zeng, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I am very fortunately supervised by [Prof. Zenglin Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=gF0H9nEAAAAJ). Before that, I received my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree from Ocean University of China (OUC) in 2020.

My research interests primarily focus on Federated Learning and Distributed Optimization. Recently, I focused on designing, analyzing, and evaluating federated optimization algorithms, considering communication and heterogeneity to achieve a high generalization model in federated learning.
